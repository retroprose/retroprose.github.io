Retroprose is a single member LLC geared towards contract work an consulting on real time web applications situated in the cloud.  So far we have helped small local game companies with netcode, setting up company websites and other various game related and not game related Unity applications.  Some day in the future Retroprose may release it's own games.  Any and all games released by Retroprose will be retro-style games with significant multiplayer additions, at least 64 players.  If this ever happens, we also plan to release our universal netcode libraries so hobbyists and indie companies can start making multiplayer games quickly and efficiently.
